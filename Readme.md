jquery.konami.coffee
====================

A jQuery plugin to listen for a user entering the konami code.

Installation
------------

Simply copy and embed jquery.konami.js into your project.

    <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.konami.js"></script>
  
Usage
-----

Simply attach the plugin to an element with a callback.

    $(window).konami(function(){ alert('Unicorn attack!')});
  
To build
--------

Yes, jQuery.konami is written in coffeescript. So you need to install [node](https://github.com/joyent/node), [npm](http://npmjs.org/), and [coffeescript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) to build. Then simply run the cake command.

    cake build
  
To run the test
---------------
  
jQuery.konami uses [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) for testing. Open up SpecRunner.html to run test. The test is also written in coffeescript, so you'll have to run _cake build_ to compile the test too.
